 * this handler will be provided to an SVNWCClient. When  calling, for example, 
 * SVNWCClient.doDelete(..) on some path, that method will  generate  an  event 
 * for each 'delete' action it will perform upon every path being deleted.  And
 * this event is passed to 
 * 
 * ISVNEventHandler.handleEvent(SVNEvent event,  double progress) 
 * 
 * to notify the handler.  The  event  contains detailed  information about the 
 * path, action performed upon the path and some other.
